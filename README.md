Brute Force Attack Defense Tool (Java)

This is a simple defensive security tool built using Java.

It protects a login system from brute-force attacks by blocking a user after multiple failed attempts.

This project demonstrates:

- How brute force attacks work

- How to defend against them

- How to implement safe login logic using Java

Features

- Accepts username and password

- Limits login attempts (default: 3 attempts)

- If a user enters incorrect credentials 3 times, the tool **blocks further attempts**

- Displays alert message when attack protection is triggered

- Shows success message on correct login

- Easy to run on any system using Java

How It Works

1. The user enters a username and password.

2. If incorrect → attempt count increases.

3. After 3 failed attempts, the system locks the login.

4. If correct → the login succeeds normally.

5. This demonstrates a defense mechanism against brute-force attacks.

How to Run the Project

1. Save the file

Save the Java file

2. Open CMD in the project folder**

 Conclusion

This tool shows how we can protect a login system from brute-force attacks by limiting login attempts and blocking unauthorized access. It is a basic but effective demonstration of a defensive cybersecurity mechanism using Java.
